Inspired by suspicions of fraud in the valuation of players in international football trades, we explored FIFA datasets over 5 years. We performed EDA on trends related to the wages and skills of players across leagues, before subsequently creating different models (Random Forest, Regressions, etc) to predict a player's transfer value based on a set of chosen attributes.
